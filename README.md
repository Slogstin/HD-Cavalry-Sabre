    * Can replace wild Chainsaws
    * roughly 20% chance of spawning
    * Weighs 85 blocks
    * Alternate between Fire and Altfire to chain swings
    * You can sprint while preparing an attack to charge at enemies
    * Moving towards enemies gives you a slightly bigger damage bonus
    * Has a thrust attack to finish off foes or inflict some good bleeding
    * Sheathing and drawing it leaves you vulnerable
    * Hit AltReload to perform a fancy sheathing animation
    * You can combo normal swings into the fancy sheathing to finish combos in style
    * Loadout code: CSB
    * Class: HDSabre

    "Here at Virid Inc. we get a lot of feedback from our mercs that here isn't a "cool" melee weapon.
    We get that! Feeling like a badass can potentially be the difference between life and death! After all,
    good morale wins you half the battle!
    So we started production of this vintage beauty! This sabre might've been retired since WW1, but that doesn't
    mean it can't slice creatures from another world into neat chunks!
